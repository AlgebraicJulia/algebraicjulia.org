	abstract = {We implement a novel representation of model search spaces as diagrams over a category of models, where we have restricted attention to a broad class of models whose structure is presented by {\textbackslash}C-sets. (Co)limits in these diagram categories allow the creation of composite model spaces from more primitive spaces. We present a novel implementation of the computer algebra of finitely presented categories and diagram categories (including their limits and colimits), which formalizes a notion of model space exploration. This is coupled with strategies to facilitate the selection of desired models from these model spaces. We demonstrate our framework by generating a tool which fits experimental data, searching an epidemiology-relevant subspace of mass-action kinetic models.},

	abstract = {Presenting systems of differential equations in the form of diagrams has become common in certain parts of physics, especially electromagnetism and computational physics. In this work, we aim to put such use of diagrams on a firm mathematical footing, while also systematizing a broadly applicable framework to reason formally about systems of equations and their solutions. Our main mathematical tools are category-theoretic diagrams, which are well known, and morphisms between diagrams, which have been less appreciated. As an application of the diagrammatic framework, we show how complex, multiphysical systems can be modularly constructed from basic physical principles. A wealth of examples, drawn from electromagnetism, transport phenomena, fluid mechanics, and other fields, is included.},

	abstract = {Pandemic management requires that scientists rapidly formulate and analyze epidemiological models in order to forecast the spread of disease and the effects of mitigation strategies. Scientists must modify existing models and create novel ones in light of new biological data and policy changes such as social distancing and vaccination. Traditional scientific modeling workflows detach the structure of a model -- its submodels and their interactions -- from its implementation in software. Consequently, incorporating local changes to model components may require global edits to the code-base through a manual, time-intensive, and error-prone process. We propose a compositional modeling framework that uses high-level algebraic structures to capture domain-specific scientific knowledge and bridge the gap between how scientists think about models and the code that implements them. These algebraic structures, grounded in applied category theory, simplify and expedite modeling tasks such as model specification, stratification, analysis, and calibration. With their structure made explicit, models also become easier to communicate, criticize, and refine in light of stakeholder feedback.},

In this paper, we describe and implement an extension of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{C\}\$-sets having data attributes with fixed types, such as graphs with labeled vertices or real-valued edge weights. We call such structures "acsets," short for "attributed \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{C\}\$-sets." Derived from previous work on algebraic databases, acsets are a joint generalization of graphs and data frames. They also encompass more elaborate graph-like objects such as wiring diagrams and Petri nets with rate constants. We develop the mathematical theory of acsets and then describe a generic implementation in the Julia programming language, which uses advanced language features to achieve performance comparable with specialized data structures.},

Although complex dynamical systems tend to have important modular structure, conventional modeling approaches suppress this structure. Building on recent work in applied category theory, we show how deterministic dynamical systems, discrete and continuous, can be composed in a hierarchical style. In mathematical terms, we reformulate some existing operads of wiring diagrams and introduce new ones, using the general formalism of C-sets (copresheaves). We then establish dynamical systems as algebras of these operads. In a computational vein, we show that Euler's method is functorial for undirected systems, extending a previous result for directed systems. All of the ideas in this paper are implemented as practical software using Catlab and the {AlgebraicJulia} ecosystem, written in the Julia programming language for scientific computing.},

More specifically, we study the algebraic nature of assembling complex dynamical systems from an interconnection of simpler ones. The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams. We define the symmetric monoidal category W, from which we may construct an operad O(W), whose objects are black boxes with input and output ports, and whose morphisms are wiring diagrams, thus prescribing the algebraic rules for interconnection. We then define two W-algebras, G and L, which associate semantic content to the structures in W. Respectively, they correspond to general and to linear systems of differential equations, in which an internal state is controlled by inputs and produces outputs. As an example, we use these algebras to formalize the classical problem of systems of tanks interconnected by pipes, and hence make explicit the algebraic relationships among systems at different levels of granularity.},

	abstract = {One goal of applied category theory is to better understand networks appearing throughout science and engineering. Here we introduce "structured cospans" as a way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Given a functor \$L {\textbackslash}colon {\textbackslash}mathsf\{A\} {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathsf\{X\}\$, a structured cospan is a diagram in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{X\}\$ of the form \$L(a) {\textbackslash}rightarrow x {\textbackslash}leftarrow L(b)\$. If \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{A\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{X\}\$ have finite colimits and \$L\$ is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{A\}\$ and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans. This is a hypergraph category. However, it arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans. We show how structured cospans solve certain problems in the closely related formalism of "decorated cospans", and explain how they work in some examples: electrical circuits, Petri nets, and chemical reaction networks.},
